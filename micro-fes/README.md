Practicing microfrontends. 

1. We will create one microfrontend for the `host` and one for the `remote`. For this we will use the following command **twice**: 
```bash
npx create-mf-app
```
2. install dependencies in each one with:
```bash
npm i
```
3. run project in each one with:
```bash
npm start
```
