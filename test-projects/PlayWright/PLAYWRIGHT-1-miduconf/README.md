# Playwright

## üß† Why?
Playwright is an E2E testing framework. It offers robust cross-browser support, reliable automation capabilities, and an extensive feature set for testing modern web applications effectively.

## üöÄ Getting Started

- Install this vs code extension:

![Playwright Test for VSCode](readme_images/playwright_extension.png)

- Create new Playwright project using:
```
Ctrl + Shift + P -> and type 'Install Playwright'
```

![Test: Install PlayWright](readme_images/test_install_playwright.png)

- Pick the browsers that you want, if you want js (ts is default), and if you want to add github actions (this is for CI/CD).

![Install PlayWright options](readme_images/test_install_playwright_options.png)

A new repository will be created.

## üîç Brief repository explanation
The following files deserve a special mention:
- `playwright.config.ts`: Playwright configuration
- `.github\workflows\playwright.yml`: GitHub actions deployment
- `tests\example.spec.ts`: Here you have an example of a Playwright test

## ü§î How to use
- Open `tests\example.spec.ts`
- Open the PlayWright testing option in the lateral menu in VS Code:

![Playwright VSCode icon](readme_images/playwright_vs_code_icon.png)

- Enable `Show browser` at the bottom of the lateral menu

![Show browser](readme_images/show_browser.png)

- Click on the green arrow at the left of the test to run it:

![green_arrow](readme_images/green_arrow.png)

- Once you run the test, if for instance you picked chromium, a chromium window will open:

![chromium](readme_images/chromium.png)

## ‚úçÔ∏è Additional features (traces and report)
- We can see step by step what happened in our test with the traces, to achieve it use these commands:

```bash
npx playwright test --trace on
```
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
Output:
![Traces and report console](readme_images/traces_and_report_console.png)

- A report with the results of the tests will be opened:

![Traces and report browser](readme_images/traces_and_report_browser.png)

- Click in one of them:

![One trace report](readme_images/one_trace_report.png)

- And if you click in the trace another window will be opened:

![trace](readme_images/trace.png)

In this window you have the actions in the left, and the timeline at the top. This way you will be able to follow step by step what happened in each moment.
