Ansible Advanced:
Ansible works with multiple servers, for this it uses SSH.
The information about this servers is stored in the inventory file. Which by default is in 'etc/ansible/hosts'. It looks like this->
'
server1.company.com
server2.company.com

[mail]
server3.company.com
server4.company.com
'
You can also put an alias to the ansible connection, and it would look like this: 'web ansible_host=server1.company.com'
The inventory parameters are:
'
ansible_connection - ssh/winrm/localhost
ansible_port - 22/5986
ansible_user - root/administrator
ansible_ssh_pass - Password (in windows-> ansible_password)
'.
So one full line may look like this:'web ansible_host=server1.company.com ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=P@#'
And an inventory file could look like this (ini):
'
# Sample Inventory File

# Web Servers
web_node1 ansible_host=web01.xyz.com ansible_connection=winrm ansible_user=administrator ansible_password=Win$Pass
web_node2 ansible_host=web02.xyz.com ansible_connection=winrm ansible_user=administrator ansible_password=Win$Pass
web_node3 ansible_host=web03.xyz.com ansible_connection=winrm ansible_user=administrator ansible_password=Win$Pass

# DB Servers
sql_db1 ansible_host=sql01.xyz.com ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=Lin$Pass
sql_db2 ansible_host=sql02.xyz.com ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=Lin$Pass

[db_nodes]
sql_db1
sql_db2

[web_nodes]
web_node1
web_node2
web_node3

[boston_nodes]
sql_db1
web_node1

[dallas_nodes]
sql_db2
web_node2
web_node3

[us_nodes:children]
boston_nodes
dallas_nodes
'

And an inventory file could look like this (YAML):
'
all:
	children:
		webservers:
			children:
				webserver_us:
					hosts:
						server1_us.com:
							ansible_host: 192.168.8.101
						server2_us.com:
							ansible_host: 192.168.8.102
				webserver_eu:
					hosts:
						server1_eu.com:
							ansible_host: 10.12.0.101
						server2_eu.com:
							ansible_host: 10.12.0.102
'

Ansible variables:
- Stores information that varies with each host
- Can be set in the inventory file, in any playbook, or in a variables file.
Playbook.yml:
'
-   name: Add DNS server to resolv.conf
	hosts: localhost
	vars:
		dns_server: 10.1.250.10
	tasks:
	  - lineinfile:
			path: /etc/resolv.conf
			line: 'nameserver {{ dns_server }}'
'
- variable types: String, Number, Boolean, List, Dictionary.
- Variable precedence: Playbook > Host > Group. 
These are just 3, the 22 precedence relations can be found in the docu: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html#understanding-variable-precedence

Registering Variables:
1.
' 
---
- name: Check /etc/hosts file
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  -	shell: cat /etc/hosts
	register: result
  - debug:
	var: result
'
In this example, with the keyword register, we store result, and then use this result in the debug module ot obtain more details about how it went.

2. 
'
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml -v
'
On the other hand, having the playbook normal, but making the script call with -v (verbose). Will also increase the amount of detail. But the detail won't be as specific as in using register. Options-> -v, -vv, -vvv.

Variable scoping:
1. Variables defined for a group of groups, a group, or a host, are considered to be host scoped.
2. Variables scroped in a play, ar play scoped. 
3. Global variables are globally scoped.

Magic variables:
Code A:
'
web1 ansible_host=172.20.1.100
web2 ansible_host=172.20.1.101 dns_server=10.5.5.4
web3 ansible_host=172.20.1.102
'
In code A. the variable for the dns_server is only available for host web2. However there is a way to be able to use the variables of other hosts. IN this case with this playbook, when instead of using '{{ dns_server }}', you use '{{ hostvars['web2'].dns_server }}', you will be able to access the variable of the host web2. Like in the following example->
'
---
- name: Print dns server
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - debug:
	msg: '{{ hostvars['web2'].dns_server }}'
'.
In addition to 'hostvars', there are more magic variables like: groups, group_names, inventory_hostname...
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html#information-about-ansible-magic-variables
And also there are 2 options to write it, both mean the same:
1. '{{ hostvars['web2'].ansible_facts.processor }}'
2. '{{ hostvars['web2'][ansible_facts][processor] }}'

Ansible Facts:
Ansible facts are data related to your remote systems, including operating systems, IP addresses... 
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html#ansible-facts
'
---
- name: Print hello message
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - debug:
    var: ansible_facts
'
And this will response with the facts of the hosts.
If you add the line: 'gather_facts: no'. It won't show any facts.
In 'etc/ansible/ansible.cfg' You can see the configuration. And by default: 'gathering = implicit'


Ansible Playbook:
- Playbook - YAML file
	- Play - Defines a set of activities (tasks) to be run on hosts
		- Task - An action to be performed on the host
			- Execute a command
			- Run a script
			- Install a package
			- Shutdown/Restart

Playbook example:
'
  -
	name: Play 1
	hosts: localhost
	tasks:
		- name: Execute command 'date'
		  command: date
		- name: Execute script on server
		  script: test_script.sh
  -
    name: Play 2
	hosts: localhost
	tasks:
		- name: Install web service
		  yum:
			name: httpd
			state: present
		- name: Start web server
		  service:
		    name: httpd
			state: started
'
Order matters. For instance in Play 2, if you put the tasks the other way. Then it will first start web server and then install it, which makes no sense.
Modules: In this case: command, script, yum and service are ansible modules.
	
Execute ansible Playbook:
ansible-playbook <playbook.yaml name>

Verifying Playbooks:
Check mode
	- dry run
	- allows preview of playbook changes without applying them
	- --check 
Diff mode
	- Provides a before and after comparison of playbook changes
	- Understand and verigy the impact of playbook changes before appplying them
	- --diff
You can use both: --check --diff, para hacer un dry run + diff.
Syntax Check
	- --syntax-check
	
Ansible lint:
- Ansible lint is a command-line tool that performs linting on Ansible playbooks, roles and collections.
- It checks your code for potential errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.
- To execute it, run: 'ansible-lint <your_script.yml>'


#.@-$#.@-$#.@-$#.@-$#.@-$#.@-$#.@-$#.@-$
Conditionals:
We use when directive to make conditions. Also 'and' and 'or'.
'
---
- name: Install NGINX
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Install NGINX on Debian
    apt: 
	  name: nginx
	  state: present
	when: ansible_os_family == "Debian" and
	      ansible_distribution_version == "16.04"

  - name: Install NGINX on Redhat
    yum:
	  name: nginx
	  state: present
	when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat" or
	      ansible_os_family == "SUSE"
'

Now another example LOOPS and conditionals.
'
---
- name: Install Softwares
  hosts: all
  vars:
	packages:
	  - name: nginx
	    required: True
      - name: mysql
	    required: True
	  - name: apache
	    required: False
  tasks:
  - name: Install "{{ item.name }}" on Debian
    apt:
	  name: "{{ item.name }}"
	  state: present
	when: item.required == True
	loop: "{{ packages }}"
'
Explanation-> In this case it will trigger first the loop conditional, and then it will execute 3 times the task. Now in each task the value will be item, and then it's executed the when conditional which checks if item.required equals True. So, in the end it it will install nginx and mysql.

Now another example using register and conditionals.
'
---
- name: Check status of a service and email if its down
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
  - name: Check HTTPD service status
    command: service httpd status
    register: result
  - name: Send email if service is down
    mail:
      to: admin@company.com
	  subject: service Alert
	  body: Httpd Service is down
	when: result.stdout.find('down') != -1
'

Conditionals and facts:
'
  - name: Install Nginx on ubuntu
    apt: 
	- name: nginx=1.18.0
	  state: present
    when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'Debian'
'

Conditionals and vars:
'
  - name: Deploy configuration files
    template:
		src: "{{ app_env }}_config.j2"
		dest: "/etc/myapp/config.conf"
	vars:
		app_env: production
'

Loops:
A code without loops to create users.
'
-
  name: Create users
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - user: name=joe         state=present
	- user: name=george      state=present
	- user: name=kirian      state=present
'

A code with loops to create users.
'
-
  name: Create users
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - user: name='{{ item }}'         state=present
	loop:
	  - joe
	  - george
	  - kirian
'

Loops with 2 keys:
'
-
  name: Create users
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - user: name='{{ item.name }}' state=present uid='{{item.uid}}'
	loop:
	  - name: joe
	    uid: 1010
	  - name: george
	    uid: 1011
	  - name: kirian
	    uid: 1012
'

Loops using With_*; :
'
-
  name: Create users
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - user: name='{{ item }}' state=present
	with_items:
	  - joe
	  - george
	  - kirian
'
In this case, with_items and loop are the same. But the loop directive is more recent so it's more recommended. 
There are more 'with' directives, like: with_items, with_file, with_url, with_mongodb.

-
  name: Play 1
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
	- name: Run a script on a remote server
	  script: /some/local/script.sh -arg1 -arg2
'
Service->
'
- name: Play 1
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Start the database service
	  service: name=postgresql state=started
'
or 

'
- name: Play 1
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Start the database service
	  service:
	    name=postgresql
		state=started
'

Why is it started and not start?
Because we are not telling Ansible to start the server. We are telling ansible to ensure that the server is started.
If http is not already started-> start it. 
If http is already started-> do nothing.

This is called Idempotency. It means that doing something once or repeating the action multiple times have the same result.

lineinfile:
'
- name: Add DNS server to resolv.conf
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - lineinfile:
	  path: /etc/resolv.conf
	  line: 'nameserver 10.1.250.10'
'
This is also idempotent. It will add the line only once, so it checks first that the lines does not already exist

Ansible PLUGINS:

  - Lookup Plugin
  - Filter Plugin
  - Connection Plugin

Ansible Handlers:
In comparison with tasks, handlers have this properties->
- Efficiency: Handlers ensure that actions are only taken when necessary, reducing unnecesary executions. For instance if several tasks require a service restart, using a handler ensure that the service is restarted only once, after all relevant tasks have completed.
- Readibility: Using them we separate the tasks that makes changes to the tasks that respond to those changes.
- Idempotence: An script can be run multiple times w/o causing unintended side effects.

Example:
'
- name: Deploy Applications
  hosts: application_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Copy Application Code
	  copy:
	    src: app_code/
		dest: /opt/application/
	  notify: Restart Application Service
  handlers:
    - name: Restart Application Service
	  service:
	    name: application_service
		state: restarted
'
This Ansible playbook deploys application code to application_servers, notifying the handler to restart the application_service after copying the code (if the code is updated).

Ansible roles:
A role is a group of tasks together. For instance, there can be a java role, mysql role, nginx role etc.
They are useful for->
- Organize
- Re-use
- Share

A mysql role for instance->
- Install pre-requisites
- Install mysql packages
- Configure mysql service
- Configure database and users
mysql-role.yaml:
'
- name: Install and configure mysql
  hosts: db-server
  tasks:
    - name: Install pre-requisites
	  yum: name=pre-req-packages state=present
	- name: Install MySQL packages
	  yum: name=mysql state=present
	- name: Install Service
	  yum: name=mysql state=started
	- name: Configure Database
	  yum: name=db1 state=present
'
mysql-role-importer.yaml:
'
- name: Install and Configure mysql
  hosts: db_servers
  roles:
    - mysql
'

Ansible Galaxy:
Ansible Galaxy is like an app store for Ansible. It's a platform where you can find, share, and download pre-built Ansible content, such as roles, collections, and playbooks, created by the community. It makes it easy to discover and reuse automation solutions, saving time and effort in managing IT infrastructure.
'ansible-galaxy', is like 'npm', but for collections and roles instead of Node packages.
e.g:
ansible-galaxy collection install network.juniper

Ansible Collection:
A collection in Ansible is like a toolbox for managing IT infrastructure. It contains various tools (such as playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins) organized into a single package. Just as a toolbox keeps different tools organized for different tasks, a collection helps manage and share automation resources efficiently.
'
---
- hosts: localhost
  collections: amazon.aws
  tasks:
    - name: Launch an EC2 instance
      ec2_instance:
        name: my-instance
        region: us-west-1
'
To install a collection from a requirements file like this:
'
---
collections:
  - name: community.general
    version: '1.0.0'
  - name: amazon.aws
    version: '1.2.1'
'
Execute this command: 
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml

Code example (1. install a collection, 2. execute a custom module)->
'
---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Install the networking_tools collection
      ansible.builtin.ansible_galaxy_collection:
        name: company_xyz.networking_tools
        source: https://galaxy.ansible.com

- hosts: switches
  collections:
    - company_xyz.networking_tools
  tasks:
    - name: Configure VLAN 10
      configure_vlan:
        vlan_id: 10
        vlan_name: Admin_VLAN
'

String manipulation (Jinja2):
'
The name is {{ my_name }} => The name is Bond
The name is {{ my_name | upper}} => The name is BOND
The name is {{ my_name | lower}} => The name is bond
The name is {{ my_name | title}} => The name is Bond
The name is {{ my_name | replace("Bond", "Bourne")}} => The name is Bourne

{{ [1, 2, 3] | min }} => 1
{{ [1, 2, 3, 2] | unique }} => 1, 2, 3
{{ [1, 2, 3, 4] | union( [4, 5] ) }} => 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
{{ 100 | random }} => Random number
'

Loop (Jinja2):
'
{% for number in [0,1,2,3,4] %}
	{{ number }}
{% endfor %}
'
Conditions (Jinja2):
'
{% for number in [0,1,2,3,4] %}
	{% if number == 2 %}
		{{ number }}
	{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
