# ☁️ AWS (Midu tutorial)

## 🤔 Why?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud. It counts with +200 different services, for things like: servers, databases, object storage, user management and more.

### 🗂️ Quick scheme with the most important services
| AWS Service   | What it is / What it’s for                           | Equivalent you may know                         |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **EC2**       | Scalable virtual servers in the cloud                | Like renting a server from a hosting provider (Blacknight, OVH) where you install Apache, Nginx, Docker, etc.  |
| **S3**        | Object storage (files, backups, static assets) via API | Google Drive for apps / MinIO bucket           |
| **RDS**       | Managed relational databases (MySQL, Postgres, etc.) | MySQL/Postgres on a server, but auto-managed   |
| **EKS**       | Managed Kubernetes service                           | Minikube / RKE2 cluster on your machine        |
| **Lambda**    | Run code on demand without managing servers (serverless) | Cron/event-driven script, but in the cloud     |
| **CloudFormation** | Infrastructure as code definition. Define AWS resources (servers, DBs, buckets) as code, auto-create them.   | Terraform (similar), not like Ansible/Rundeck  |

### ↕️ Vertical scaling vs ↔️ horizontal scaling
- **Vertical scaling**: Add more power (CPU/RAM) to a single server.  
  - Pros: simpler, cheaper, usually better cost efficiency.  
  - Cons: downtime when upgrading.  

- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more servers to handle load.  
  - Pros: no downtime.  
  - Cons: more complex, more expensive.

### 😊 EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Example configuration of a demo for EC2

![alt text](image/1.png)

Once the EC2 instance has been launched, we can see it if we go to the instances page:

For example, the public address is: `18.185.48.185`. Although if we open it right now, it doesn't show anything. We will see how to make it work in the next section.

**How to connect to the EC2 machine**

1. Click on the button **Connect**
2. Go to **SSH client**
3. Copy the command

4. Apply chmod restrictions to the `.pem` file: 
   1. `chmod 400 ~/.ssh/cosme-demo-ssh.pem`
   2. In windows, you might have to copy the `.pem` file into inside the WSL (as you can see in the next picture).
5. Execute the command to connect with ssh to the EC2 instance.

6. We configure a server with python inside the EC2 instance.

7. We can now connect to the server (make sure to use **http** in the URL since we are using port 80 for the server!)

The following services are 🗄️ **Database services.** And we will see a practical example with **RDS (Relational Database Service).**

### 🗄️ DocumentDB 📚
**Summary: MongoDB like Database Service.** | - - - - - |
DocumentDB is a document database service designed to be compatible with MongoDB. It allows developers to store, query, and index JSON-like data at scale.

### 🗄️ DynamoDB ⚡
**Summary: Key-Value and Document NoSQL Database.** | - - - - - |
DynamoDB is a NoSQL database. It supports both key-value and document data models. It is very fast; can be used for low-latency games, or real-time analytics apps.


### 🗄️ MemoryDB 🤓
**Summary: Redis like Service.** | - - - - - |
MemoryDB is a Redis-compatible in-memory database service that stores data in RAM for ultra-fast access, ideal for caching and real-time applications.
