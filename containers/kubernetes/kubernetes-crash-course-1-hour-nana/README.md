# KUBERNETES

## üß† What?
It's an orchestration tool, to manage multiple containers.
- High availability
- Scalability
- Disaster recovery

## üóÑÔ∏è Architecture
- Master node
- Worker nodes (have the applications running)

### Master node
It has several Kubernetes processes:
- **API Server**: The entry point of a K8s cluster.
- **Controller Manager**: Tracks cluster state and performs corrective actions.
- **Scheduler**: Decides where Pods should be placed.
- **etcd**: A key-value store that holds the cluster's state.

### Architecture in general
- Master nodes: 
  - Control plane nodes
  - Handful of master processes
  - Much more important
    - It is absolutely necessary to have a backup of the master
- Worker nodes: 
  - Higher workload
  - Much bigger and more resources
  - Has a Kubelet to manage Pods locally and communicate with the master.

### Node and Pod

**Node:**
- Virtual or physical machine
- Nodes can be:
  - Master nodes (control plane)
  - Worker nodes (where application Pods run)

**Pod:**
- Is the smallest unit in Kubernetes
- An abstraction over containers
- Usually 1 Application per Pod
- Each pod gets its own IP address
- Pods are **ephemeral** (They can die easily)
  - If a Pod dies, Kubernetes may replace it with a new Pod, which gets a new IP address.

### Service and Ingress

**Service:**
- **Permanent** IP address
- Lifecycle of Pod and Service not connected
  - If a Pod dies and is replaced, the Service ensures that the node IP does not change (it redirects to the new Pod)
- Acts as a **load balancer** for Pods behind it.

**Ingress:**

From `http://192.168.1.100:30001` to `https://my-app.com`
- Provides **external HTTP and HTTPS access** to services within the cluster.
- Transforms a cluster‚Äôs internal service into a user-friendly URL like `my-app.com`.
- **Acts like a reverse proxy**, routing traffic to the appropriate Service based on rules.
- While it provides domain-like URLs, it does not replace DNS:
  - The actual DNS for `my-app.com` must resolve to the cluster's Ingress Controller or Load Balancer IP.
