# KUBERNETES

## üß† What?
It's an orchestration tool, to manage multiple containers.
- High availability
- Scalability
- Disaster recovery

## üóÑÔ∏è Architecture
- Master node
- Several Kubelet (Worker nodes)
  The worker nodes have the applications running

### Master node
It has several kubernetes processes:
- API Server (a container): It's the entry point of a K8s cluster
- Controller Manager: Keeps track of whats happening in the cluster
- Scheduler: Ensures Pods placement
- etcd: Kubernetes backing store

### Architecture in general
- Master nodes: 
  - Control plane nodes
  - Handful of master processes
  - Much more important
    - It is absolutely necessary to have a backup of the master
- Worker nodes: 
  - Higher workload
  - Much bigger and more resources

## ü•ô Kubernetes component

### List
- Node
- Pod
- Service
- Ingress
- ConfigMap
- Secret
- Deployment
- StatefulSet
- DaemonSet

### Node and Pod

Node: Virtual or physical machine

Pod:
- Is the smallest unit in Kubernetes (it's a node)
- Abstraction over container
- Usually 1 Application per Pod
