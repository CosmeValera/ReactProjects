## ðŸš¢ Volumes in k8s (PV, PVC, SC...)
To persist data in K8s using volumes, we will see the following components:
- **Persistent Volume**
- **Persistent Volume Claim**
- **Storage Class**

### ðŸ§  Why?
Imagine you have 2 pods: `my-app` and `mysql`. With `my-app` you add and update data to the db `mysql`. 

However, by default, when you restart the `mysql` pod, all those changes get lost. This is because, **Kubernetes doesn't provide data persistence out of the box**, you need to configure that for each application that needs saving data between pods restart.

### ðŸ«™ Storage requirements
For this, 1. you need to have storage that **doesn't depend on the pod lifecycle**.

However, you don't know from which node will the pod restart in. 2. So the storage must be **available to all nodes***. 

And, 3. Storage needs to **survive** even if **cluster crashes**.

<small> *Minikube has by default only one node that acts as both master and worker. You can try commands: `kubectl get nodes` and `minikube node add`</small>
